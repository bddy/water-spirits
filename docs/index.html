                The installation Water Spirits is a volunteer project for the <a
                    href="https://www.singoldsand-festival.de/" target="_blank">Singoldsand Festival</a> 2017 and 2018.
                The basic idea is to create audience-controlled music visuals using the Microsoft Kinect.
                To accomplish this, depth data from people moving in front of the camera is processed to create the
                effects, which are then projected onto a surface next to the stage. If the movements of the audience
                follow the music rhythmically, visuals are created accordingly. The first approach of projecting the
                image onto a waterfall was discarded, but the flowing character was kept. Hence the name Water Spirits.
            </p>

                Besides the programmatic part, a housing for the technical devices had to be built. This was disguised
                as an old outdoor toilet standing close to the audience and it was built largely from recycled scrap
                wood.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both the programmatic part and the construction of the housing was realized by <a
                    href="https://github.com/bddy" target="_blank">Sebastian Oley</a> together with the lovely crew at
                Singoldsand Festival. â™¥
