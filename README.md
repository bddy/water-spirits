# Water Spirits

The installation Water Spirits is a volunteer project for the Singoldsand Festival 2017 and 2018. The basic idea is to create audience-controlled music visuals using the Microsoft Kinect.

To accomplish this, depth data from people dancing in front of the camera is processed to create the visuals, which are then projected onto a surface next to the stage. If the movements of the audience follow the music rhythmically, visuals are created accordingly.

The first approach of projecting the image onto a waterfall was discarded, but the flowing character was kept. Hence the name Water Spirits.
